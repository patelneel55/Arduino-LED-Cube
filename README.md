# Arduino LED Cube
A 4 x 4 x 4 LED cube that displays random patterns built with 64 LEDs and an Arduino

## Requirements
For this project, you will require the following items. 
For reference, I have linked the websites from where I got my components:

1. [Arduino Uno](https://www.amazon.com/Elegoo-Board-ATmega328P-ATMEGA16U2-Arduino/dp/B01EWOE0UU/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1515696726&sr=8-3&keywords=arduino+uno) (You can also use an Arduino Nano, but you would have to attach it to a breadboard and solder the pins on manually)

2. [Diffused LEDs](https://www.amazon.com/100pcs-Ultra-Bright-Emitting-Diffused/dp/B01GE4WEGI/ref=sr_1_3?s=industrial&ie=UTF8&qid=1515696906&sr=1-3&keywords=blue+diffused+led) (You can also use multicolor LEDs rather than make the whole cube the same color): Diffused LEDs help disperse the light, i:e makes it brighter, and make it visible from all angles.

3. [Soldering Iron & Solder](https://www.amazon.com/Tabiger-Soldering-110V-Adjustable-Temperature-Welding/dp/B01H1IFT54/ref=sr_1_4?s=industrial&ie=UTF8&qid=1515696971&sr=1-4&keywords=soldering+iron): This is a tool that helps attach metals together.

4. [Breadboard](https://www.amazon.com/microtivity-IB400-400-point-Experiment-Breadboard/dp/B0084A7PI8/ref=sr_1_7?s=industrial&ie=UTF8&qid=1515697015&sr=1-7&keywords=breadboard)

Optional:

[Solder Flux](https://www.amazon.com/Rosin-Soldering-Flux-Paste-50G/dp/B00SVESNTC/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1515771726&sr=8-6&keywords=solder+flux): This is applied on the soldering iron and/or the metal, that is being soldered, so that the solder can easily stick on the metal.

## Starting the Project
To run the LED cube program you will first need to build a LED cube

To get started, go through the sources [below](##Sources) which will aid you in constructing the LED cube

### Installation
If you don't already have Arduino IDE installed, download the IDE from [Arduino's download page](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)

## Uploading to Arduino

To upload the code to the Arduino from your desktop or laptop:

1. Download the latest version of LEDCube.ino inside the LEDCube folder.

2. Double-click on the file which will automatically open in the Arduino IDE.

3. Connect the Arduino to the device using a [USB A-B]()(Arduino Uno) or [USB A-Micro B]()(Arduino Uno).

4. Once the Arduino is connected to the computer and the Arduino IDE is opened, click the *Verify* ![alt text](https://github.com/patelneel55/Arduino-LED-Cube/blob/master/resources/verify.PNG "Compile button") in the top left of the IDE

5. After it successfully compiles the program, click the *Upload* ![alt text](https://github.com/patelneel55/Arduino-LED-Cube/blob/master/resources/upload.PNG "Upload button") button at the top left of the IDE, which will upload the program to the Arduino and start the program on the cube.

## Finally

You can continue running the LED Cube endlessly with a USB cable or you can attach a [2.1mm AC power adapter](https://www.amazon.com/NorthPada-Raspberry-Supply-Charger-Adapter/dp/B01N336XEU/ref=sr_1_4?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1515780078&sr=1-4&keywords=power+supply+adapter+for+raspberry+pi) to one of your wall sockets.
