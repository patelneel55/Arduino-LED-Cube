# Arduino LED Cube
A 4 x 4 x 4 LED cube that displays random patterns built with 64 LEDs and an Arduino

## Requirements
For this project to successfully work, you will need to fulfill the following requirements. 
For reference, I have linked the websites from where I got my components:

1. [Arduino Uno](https://www.amazon.com/Elegoo-Board-ATmega328P-ATMEGA16U2-Arduino/dp/B01EWOE0UU/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1515696726&sr=8-3&keywords=arduino+uno) (You can also use an Arduino Nano, but you would have to attach it to a breadboard and solder the pins on manually)

2. [Diffused LEDs](https://www.amazon.com/100pcs-Ultra-Bright-Emitting-Diffused/dp/B01GE4WEGI/ref=sr_1_3?s=industrial&ie=UTF8&qid=1515696906&sr=1-3&keywords=blue+diffused+led) (You can also use multicolor LEDs rather than make the whole cube the same color)

3. [Soldering Iron & Solder](https://www.amazon.com/Tabiger-Soldering-110V-Adjustable-Temperature-Welding/dp/B01H1IFT54/ref=sr_1_4?s=industrial&ie=UTF8&qid=1515696971&sr=1-4&keywords=soldering+iron)

4. [Breadboard](https://www.amazon.com/microtivity-IB400-400-point-Experiment-Breadboard/dp/B0084A7PI8/ref=sr_1_7?s=industrial&ie=UTF8&qid=1515697015&sr=1-7&keywords=breadboard)

Optional:

[Solder Flux]()

## Setup
This Arduino LED Cube requires hardware 
To run the LED cube program you will first need to build a LED cube
